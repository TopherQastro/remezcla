This is my rhyming dictionary, listed as .csv entries with each word separated by a ^ (carrot). The word you're searching for should be on the left of the comma, and its results are on the left (many words have matching lists). The letter "T" means the total amount of syllables in the results, and the letter "R" corresponds to the number of matching syllables from the right.
