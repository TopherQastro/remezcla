 Welcome to the Remezcla project, which basically translates to English as "remix." This is the code I used to create the poetry that I've posted here.
 
 The basic concept of this software is to read through the text of a target string and to "remix" it into a poetic structure that's based on the target's own lexicon and grammatical form. The user dictates the rhythmic meter and rhyming arrangement of each line upon startup, which allows for such templates as limmericks, sonnets, and many more.
 
 For the moment, I don't have the rhyming data that accompanies this code on Github, so the program will fail and stall if you run it. I'm currently between operating systems right now, and am running off of a USB flash drive. Once I revive my machine I'll upload the rest. Also, you will need to have installed all the necessary imports, especially NLTK.
 
 I would welcome any suggestions. Have fun looking around.
