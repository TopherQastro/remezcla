 Welcome to the Remezcla project, which basically translates to English as "remix." This is the code I used to create the poetry that I've posted here.
 
 The basic concept of this software is to read through the text of a target string and to "remix" it into poetic structurebased on the target's own lexicon and grammatical structure(s). The user dictates the rhythmic meter and rhyming arrangement of each line upon startup, which allows for such templates as limmericks, sonnets, and more.
 
 For the moment, I don't have the data that accompanies this code on Github, so IT WILL NOT WORK IF YOU TRY IT. I'm still trying to understand all this computer stuff. The software reads libraries for each word that contains data on its phonetic form, including data that shows where emphasis goes, allowing for meter. This data also helped create a dictionary for rhymes.
 
 Hopefully I'll be able to develop this even more.
